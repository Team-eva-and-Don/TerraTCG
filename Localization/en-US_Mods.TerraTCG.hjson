	Tutorial: {
		Slide0:
			'''
			Welcome to TerraTCG, the Terraria Trading Card Game! To start a game,
			try talking to an NPC and selecting "Let's Duel!". Not every NPC is
			currently supported, but more will be added in the future.
			'''
		Slide1:
			'''
			TerraTCG is a card game played between two players. Each player begins by 
			shuffling their deck and drawing 5 cards. One player is then selected
			randomly to go first.
			'''
		Slide2:
			'''
			Each player has a pool of 3 resource types, used in different ways:
			- Hearts, which are lost whenever a creature the player controls dies.
			- Mana Crystals, used to attack and play items, which grow by 1 per turn.
			- A Townsfolk Emblem, used to play Townsfolk, which refreshes every turn.
			'''
		Slide3:
			'''
			Hearts represent a player's remaining life total. One heart is lost
			whenever a creature the player controls dies, and a player loses the
			game when all of their hearts are depleted.
			'''
		Slide4:
			'''
			Mana Crystals are consumed when performing most game actions, such as
			attacking with a creature or playing an item. Players start with a single
			crystal on turn 1, then gain an additional crystal per turn up to 8 on
			turn 8. 
			'''
		Slide5:
			'''
			The Townsfolk Emblem is used to cast Townfolk cards, powerful single-use
			effects that can singlehandedly turn the tide of a game. One Townsfolk 
			Emblem is generated per turn.
			'''
		Slide6:
			'''
			There are 3 types of Card in TerraTCG:
			- Creatures, which are placed onto the battlefield for combat
			- Items, which provide temporary or permanent buffs to creatures
			- Townsfolk, which provide powerful single-use effects like card draw.
			'''
		Slide7:
			'''
			Creatures are the core of gameplay. They can be placed onto the battlefield
			from the hand for no cost. 
			'''
		Slide8:
			'''
			To play a creature, click on that creature in hand, then on an appropriate 
			empty zone on your battlefield.
			'''
		Slide9:
			'''
			Fighter creatures are meant for combat, and should be placed in the Offense 
			row. Only creatures in the Offense Row (Sword Icons) may attack.
			'''
		Slide10: "Creatures enter the battlefield Paused, and must wait a turn to act. "
		Slide11:
			'''
			Critter creatures lack combat prowess, but have powerful skills that 
			support other creatures in combat. 
			'''
		Slide12:
			'''
			Critters are vulnerable to attacks from enemies, but can be protected 
			by placing them in the Defense Row (Shield Icon) in the same column as 
			another friendly creature.
			'''
		Slide13:
			'''
			Items can be attached to creatures and provide bonuses to their stats. It 
			costs Mana Crystals to play Items from the hand. 
			'''
		Slide14:
			'''
			To play an Item, click the Item's card in hand, then an appropriate target
			creature on the field. 
			'''
		Slide15:
			'''
			Hover over a creature's card preview to see which item buffs are currently
			affecting it!
			'''
		Slide16:
			'''
			Townsfolk are a special card type that provide powerful sources of advantage,
			like card draw and extra mana crystals. You can only use one Townsfolk per 
			turn, which consumes your single Townsfolk Emblem.
			'''
		Slide17:
			'''
			Once all Mana Crystals and the Townsfolk Emblem are used, and all 
			creatures on your field are Paused, you can take no additional game actions. 
			Click the "Pass" button to pass turn to your opponent.
			'''
		Slide18:
			'''
			Your opponent plays their own creatures, items, and townsfolk during their
			turn. Once they pass back to you, your creatures will Unpause and be able
			to act! 
			'''
		Slide19:
			'''
			Expert Creatures are a special creature type that can be placed on top
			of an Unpaused creature with the same Biome and Combat Role. Both the 
			Wraith and Zombie are Forest Fighters, so the Zombie can be Promoted!
			'''
		Slide20:
			'''
			To promote an Expert creature, click on that creature in hand, then a
			matching creature on the field.
			'''
		Slide21:
			'''
			Critters have skills that support your other creatures. Click on an Unpaused 
			Critter to use its skill. Here, the Bunny grants you an extra Mana Crystal!
			Using a creature's skill Pauses it until the next turn.
			'''
		Slide22:
			'''
			At any point in your turn, you may declare an attack with a creature in your
			Offense Row. Attacking with a creature consumes Mana Crystals equal to that
			creature's attack cost and Pauses it until your next turn.
			'''
		Slide23:
			'''
			To declare on an attack, click on a creature in your Offense Row first, then
			any opposing creature. 
			'''
		Slide24: "The opposing Bunny takes 4 damage from the attack. "
		Slide25:
			'''
			Once a creature's life is fully depleted, it will die, and the opponent will 
			lose 1 Life Point. Repeat this process until the opponent's hearts are gone
			to win the game!
			'''
		Slide26:
			'''
			Winning a game of TerraTCG grants you several TerraTCG booster packs. 
			Open them to obtain new cards for your collection! Townsfolk will give
			packs that contain cards themed to their decks.
			'''
		Slide27:
			'''
			Defeating an NPC once will unlock a second, more challenging deck for
			that NPC. Defeat this second deck to earn an Invitation to Duel, a 
			mystical item that allows you to challenge the Bosses themselves to
			a game of TerraTCG!
			'''
		Slide28:
			'''
			Defeat a boss in battle to earn rare promo cards! Do you have what it takes
			to defeat every* boss in a game of TerraTCG?

			*TerraTCG currently supports every Pre-Hardmode boss.
			'''
		Slide29:
			'''
			A TerraTCG Deckbox, crafted with 5 wood at a workbench, can be used to
			edit your decks. Experiment with the cards you get from booster packs, and 
			challenge more difficult opponents!
			'''
		Slide30: That's all for this tutorial. Talk to me again to challenge me to a game!
