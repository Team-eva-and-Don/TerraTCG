TerraTCG is a Collectible Card Game built inside of Terraria! Challenge your
friends, Town NPCs, and bosses to intense games of 1v1 card-based combat, 
grow your collection with booster packs, and experiment with exciting new strategies! 
The initial set of TerraTCG contains over 100 cards, with over 25 NPC decks,
11 boss fights, and a friendly PvP mode!

PvP is now available!
---------------------
You can now invite your friends to duel! Craft 3 Duel Invitations into a
"Friendly Duel Invitation" at work bench, then use the item in a multiplayer
server to find a friendly game with another player!

Enjoy a game of TerraTCG with your NPCs!
----------------------------------------
To get an early start to your TerraTCG collection, you can find packs scattered
throughout chests in any newly generated world!

You can start growing your collection by playing against and beating any of the 
following NPCs:
- the Guide
- the Merchant
- the Nurse
- the Arms Dealer
- the Goblin Tinkerer
- the Traveling Merchant
- the Dryad
- the Clothier
- the Mechanic
- the Nerdy Slime

After defeating the Wall of Flesh in card-based combat (see below), the following NPCs
may also be challenged:
- the Party Girl
- the Zoologist

Beating an NPC's initial deck will unlock a more challenging deck for that opponent!

Grow your Collection!
---------------------
All 100+ TerraTCG cards can be obtained by opening packs rewarded by beating NPCs or
bosses in a game! Each pack has a 1-in-15 chance to upgrade a card to a rare foil
variant!

Up the Stakes!
--------------
Once you've gotten enough practice playing against your Townsfolk, you're ready to
challenge the bosses themselves! Beating an NPC's second deck awards you with an
"Duel Invitation", an item that can be used in the presence of a boss to start
a life-or-death game of TerraTCG! The loser of a boss game's soul is forfeit!
Currently, the following bosses can be fought:
- All Pre-Hardmode Bosses
- The Queen Slime
- The Mechanical Bosses

Disclaimers
-----------
- The mod is known to have a couple compatibility issues with High FPS Support
  mod, but should still be playable while it is installed
