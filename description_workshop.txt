TerraTCG is a Collectible Card Game built inside of Terraria! Challenge your
friends, Town NPCs, and bosses to intense games of 1v1 card-based combat, 
grow your collection with booster packs, and experiment with exciting new strategies! 
The initial set of TerraTCG contains over 100 cards, with over 25 NPC decks,
11 boss fights, and a friendly PvP mode!

[h2] PvP is now available! [/h2]

You can now invite your friends to duel! Craft 3 Duel Invitations into a
"Friendly Duel Invitation" at work bench, then use the item in a multiplayer
server to find a friendly game with another player!

[h2] Getting Started [/h2]

To begin playing TerraTCG in-game, craft a TerraTCG Deckbox at a workbench using
5 wood. The Deckbox gives access to the Deck Editor. You'll only start with a few cards, 
but more can be gained by defeating any town NPC in a duel! To kickstart your collection,
you can also find a small number of packs scattered in chests in any newly generated world.
Talk to the Guide first for a good first opponent, and the option to view an in-game tutorial! 
Beyond the guide, the following NPCs can all be challenged to a game at any point:

[list]
[*] the Guide
[*] the Merchant
[*] the Nurse
[*] the Arms Dealer
[*] the Goblin Tinkerer
[*] the Traveling Merchant
[*] the Clothier
[*] the Dryad
[*] the Mechanic
[*] the Nerdy Slime
[/list]

After defeating the Wall of Flesh in card-based combat (see below), the following NPCs
may also be challenged:
[list]
[*] the Party Girl
[*] the Zoologist
[/list]


[h2] Grow your Collection [/h2]
All 100 TerraTCG cards can be obtained by opening packs rewarded by beating NPCs or
bosses in a game! Each pack has a 1-in-15 chance to upgrade a card to a rare foil
variant!

[h2] Up the Stakes! [/h2]

Once you've gotten enough practice playing against your Townsfolk, you're ready to
challenge the bosses themselves! Beating an NPC's second deck awards you with a
"Duel Invitation", an item that can be used in the presence of a boss to start
a life-or-death game of TerraTCG! Defeating a boss in a game of TerraTCG will 
slay the boss and unlock its progress in the world, but losing that game will
result in death! The following bosses can currently be fought:

[list]
[*] All Pre-Hardmode Bosses
[*] The Queen Slime
[*] The Mechanical Bosses
[/list]

mod, but should still be playable while it is installed.

[h2] How to Play [/h2]

For a full illustrated gameplay tutorial, talk to the Guide in-game
and ask to duel!

[h3] Initial Setup [/h3]

TerraTCG is a card game played between two players. Each player begins by 
shuffling their deck and drawing 5 cards. One player is then selected
randomly to go first.

Each player has 3 resource types:
[list]
[*] Hearts: The player's life total. Each player starts with 4 hearts, 
losing one whenever a Creature they control dies. If a player loses all 
4 hearts, their opponent wins the game!

[*] Mana Crystals: Spent to perform most actions in the game, such as 
attacking with Creatures or equipping Items. Start at 1 per turn,
then regenerate at a growing rate throughout the game.

[*] Townsfolk Emblem: Used to cast Townsfolk, powerful one-off cards that
can turn the tide of the game. Only 1 is generated per turn.
[/list]

[h3] Card Types [/h3]

There are 3 types of Card in TerraTCG:
[list]
[*] Creatures, which are placed onto the battlefield for combat
[*] Items, which provide temporary or permanent buffs to creatures
[*] Townsfolk, which provide powerful single-use effects like card draw.
[/list]

Creature Cards are the core of gameplay. They can be placed onto the battlefield
from the hand for no cost. At any point in your turn, you may declare an attack 
with a creature in your Offense Row. Attacking with a creature consumes Mana 
Crystals equal to that creature's attack cost. Dealing damage to opponents'
creatures via attacks is key to victory, since you need to reduce 3 opposing
creatures' health to zero to win the game!


Item Cards can be attached to creatures, and provide bonuses to their stats. It 
costs Mana Crystals to play Items from the hand. Items provide effects such as
[list]
[*] Increasing a creature's attack damage
[*] Reducing a creature's attack cost
[*] Restoring a creature's health
[/list]

Carefully balancing your Mana Crystal usage between buffing creatures with items 
and dealing damage will allow you to gain advantage over your opponent over the
course of a game!


Townsfolk are a special card type that provide powerful sources of advantage,
such as:
[list]
[*] Drawing cards
[*] Gaining extra mana crystals
[*] Buffing your creatures without spending Mana Crystals
[/list]

You can only use one Townsfolk per turn, which consumes your single Townsfolk Emblem.
